## Carrier Action

### Minority Carrier diffusion equations

- All information given is an input to the equation.
- Pay attention to the units - often mixed up
- Write down full equation then simplify it using information from question
  - e.g. steady state sets a part to 0, in the dark removes photogeneration setting another part to 0, values being much greater/smaller than others can be ignored, etc
- typically reduces to a simple differential equation which is solved using the boundary conditions
- these will be approximations, not solving it exactly

## Masses and transport and band structure

- need to know the masses of silicon, mobility of silicon for both electrons and holes, the ellipsoids
- adding conductivity is like adding resistances
- questions will be in non-degenerate conditions to prevent just using a calculator
- need to be good at manipulating the simple eqiuations like mobility, diffusion coeddicition, current density etc
- standard formula for band energy formula
- use hbar not h
