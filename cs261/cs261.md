# Mnemonics

I'm just gonna record some of my mnemonics here, no real notes. Recommend https://www.joeyh.dev/notes for good ones.
Some of them use things specific to me so maybe won't be as useful to you :/

## Software Processes

**S-DIVE** - all software process models have these stages:

- Specification - what the software should do
- Design and Implementation - how it is organised and implemented
- Validation - checking software does what the customer asked
- Evolution - how the software changes over time

## Waterfall Model

**Rivers Suck In Infant Orangutans**

- Requirement analysis
- System Design
- Implementation and Unit Testing
- Integration and Validation
- Operation and Maintenance

## Requirements Engineering

**FEAS-V**

- Feasibility Report - is the general idea possible
- Elicitation and Analysis - finding requirements and analysing them - organisation, prioritisation, etc
- Specification - creating the document with the final set of requirements
- Verification - checking with the customer that the requirements are acceptable

### Elicitation and Analysis

**Dad Can't Open Peter's New Shed**

- Discovery
- Classification and Organisation
- Prioritisation and Negotiation
- Specification

## Requirement Set Qualities

**Mat Pet Tammy's Coat**

- Modifiable - must be able to revise the set of requirements when necessary
- Prioritised - assign an implementation priority to each requirement to indicate its necessity compared to other requirements
- Traceable - should be able to link each requirement to it's source - higher-level requirement, customer statement, external standard/law compliance, etc.
- Consistent - requirements don't conflict in what they describe

## Individual Requirement Qualities

**FUN VC**

- Feasible - is it possible to achieve this requirement
- Unambiguous - can this requirement be misinterpreted in any way
- Necessary - is it necessary for the software to do this
- Verifiable - once implemented, is it possible to test if the feature works
- Correct - Each requirement accurately describes the functionality to be delivered

## Dependability Principles

**RACISM**

- Reliability - how long will a service be working
- Availability - how often the product will be ready when needed
- Confidentiality - is the data safe
- Integrity - is the data correct
- Safety - will any physical/mental damage occur from failings of the software
- Maintainability - how quickly will errors be fixed and how easy it is to fix errors

## Human Computer Interaction Key Points

**Mat Ate A Cheese**

- Memory
- Attention
- Affordances
- Cognition

## Norman Human Act Cycle

**Feeding Insects Protein Eradicates Fertitlity in Insects Entirely**

- Form a goal
- Incentive to act
- Plan to act
- Execute plan
- Feedback received
- Interpret feedback
- Evaluate feedback

## Gestalt Human Laws

**Fleeing Curiously Small People Cures Cancer Fast**

- Foreground - we tend to segment vision into foreground (focus) and background objects
- Closure - try to form single shapes/patterns by grouping complex ones
- Similar objects - if objects look similar, assume they behave in similar ways
- Proximity - if objects are close, we assume they are related/behave similarly
- Common region - objects that are in enclosed areas are perceived as related
- Continuity - objects in a line/smooth curve are perceived as related
- Focal point - drawn to objects that are unique/stand out in an image

## Neilson Usability Principles

**HM CHAUFER-V** Her Majesty's CHAUFER-V

- Help users recover from errors
- Match real world ith system
- Consistent and standardised
- Help and documentation available
- Aesthetic
- User control
- Flexibility
- Error prevention
- Recognition not recall
- Visibility

## User Acceptance Testing Process

**Dave Punched Dino, Never Again**

- Define acceptance criteria
- Plan acceptance test
- Derive acceptance tests
- Negotiate results
- Accept/reject system

## SOLID OOP Design Principles

**SOLID**

- Single Responsibility - a class is responsible for a singl pieve of functionality, encapsulating all needed data/methods
- Open/Closed - open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution - child classes can be used as their parent class without the object using it knowing
- Interface segregation - many specific interfaces are better than a general interface, with no code required that will not be used.
- Dependency inversion - high-level classes should not rely on many functions of low level classes, with interactions going from low level to high level while depending on well defined interfaces.

## Mitigating software errors

**GDDR** like GDPR

- Graceful Degredation - allows some services to keep functioning while others fail
- Diversity - having components use different tools/systems to prevent similar errors/failures in all components
- Redundancy - having older/alternative services that can be used if the main one fails

## Creational Software Patterns

**Factories build Protoypes**

- Factories - builds a specific object (usually made of smaller objects so requires lots of code) fast.
- Builder - builds a customisable object based on the methods called
- Prototype - builds a single object at the start which is then cloned to make more

## Structural Software Patterns

**FAP Daily**

- Flyweight - many objects share the same properties, store only one copy and make references in all objects
- Adaptor - Convert data format/interaction to allow use with other services
- Proxy - reference object without instantiating it - placeholder for the real object which is only called when needed, e.g. store video proxy when loading multiple videos that could be chosen and only bring full video into memory when clicked
- Decorator - adds new behaviour to objects, alternative to subclasses. Wraps original object and extends functionality

## Behavioural Software Patterns

**I Make Shit Options**

- Iterator - traverses a container to access elements in order without exposing data structure
- Memento - save and restore objects to previous versions - objects make a snapshot of itself and stores in a *memento* object thats stored externally
- Strategy - select method to complete a task at runtime - strategy object is used for decision making and can be swapped out
- Observer - objects dependant on other objects are notified if state change occurs, can be push to dependants or wait for dependant to pull changes

## Architectural Software Patterns

**Mat Really Likes Property**

- MVC - model view controller: model stores system state/data, view is what is shown to the user, controller interprets user actions and passes them to model to update state/data
- Repository - central repository stores all data in system, subsystems don't often interact directly but instead make changes to repository that affects each other
- Layered - system in layers that provide services to the layer above and use those from the layer below
- Pipe and filter - data input to pipe, discrete processing components filter data as it flows down pipe, transforming input data to produce output
