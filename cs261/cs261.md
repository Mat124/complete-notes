# Mnemonics

I'm just gonna record some of my mnemonics here, no real notes. Recommend https://www.joeyh.dev/notes for good ones.

## Software Process

**S-DIVE** - all software process models have these stages:

- Specification - what the software should do
- Design and Implementation - how it is organised and implemented
- Validation - checking software does what the customer asked
- Evolution - how the software changes over time

## Waterfall Model

**Rivers Suck In Infant Orangutans**

- Requirement analysis
- System Design
- Implementation and Unit Testing
- Integration and Validation
- Operation and Maintenance

## Requirements Engineering

**FEAS-V**

- Feasibility Report - is the general idea possible
- Elicitation and Analysis - finding requirements and analysing them - organisation, prioritisation, etc
- Specification - creating the document with the final set of requirements
- Verification - checking with the customer that the requirements are acceptable

### Elicitation and Analysis

**Dad Can't Open Peter's New Shed**

- Discovery
- Classification and Organisation
- Prioritisation and Negotiation
- Specification

## Requirement Set Qualities

**Mat Pet Tammy's Coat** (this works for me as my cat is called Tammy, possibly won't for anyone else :/)

- Modifiable - must be able to revise the set of requirements when necessary
- Prioritised - assign an implementation priority to each requirement to indicate its necessity compared to other requirements
- Traceable - should be able to link each requirement to it's source - higher-level requirement, customer statement, external standard/law compliance, etc.
- Consistent - requirements don't conflict in what they describe

## Individual Requirement Qualities

**FUN VC**

- Feasible - is it possible to achieve this requirement
- Unambiguous - can this requirement be misinterpreted in any way
- Necessary - is it necessary for the software to do this
- Verifiable - once implemented, is it possible to test if the feature works
- Correct - Each requirement accurately describes the functionality to be delivered

## Dependability Principles

**RACISM**

- Reliability - how long will a service be working
- Availability - how often the product will be ready when needed
- Confidentiality - is the data safe
- Integrity - is the data correct
- Safety - will any physical/mental damage occur from failings of the software
- Maintainability - how quickly will errors be fixed and how easy it is to fix errors

## Human Computer Interaction Key Points

**Mat Ate A Cheese**

- Memory
- Attention
- Afordances
- Cognition

## Norman Human Act Cycle

**Feeding Insects Protein Eradicates Fertitlity in Insects Entirely**

- Form a goal
- Incentive to act
- Plan to act
- Execute plan
- Feedback received
- Interpret feedback
- Evaluate feedback

## Gestal Human Laws

**Fleeing Curiously Small People Cures Cancer Fast**

- Foreground
- Closure (make shapes)
- Similar objects
- Proximity
- Common region
- Continuity
- Focal point

## Neilson Usability Principles

**HM CHAUFER-V** Her Majesty's CHAUFER-V

- Help users recover from errors
- Match real world ith system
- Consistent and standardised
- Help and documentation available
- Aesthetic
- User control
- Flexibility
- Error prevention
- Recognition not recall
- Visibility

## User Acceptance Testing Process

**Dave Punched Dino, Never Again**

- Define acceptance criteria
- Plan acceptance test
- Derive acceptance tests
- Negotiate results
- Accept/reject system
